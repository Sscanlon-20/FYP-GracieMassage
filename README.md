## Final Year Project by Sarah Scanlon - Creative Computing Student at SETU 
## Gracie Massage Web Application
### About the Project

In the Spring of 2023, I embarked on creating a website for Gracie Massage, a budding massage business. Due to time constraints, I initially developed a basic site using a pre-designed template from Wix. However, with the business's expansion, it's now time for a significant upgrade.

One of the primary enhancements will be the integration of an online booking system, a feature lacking in the current website. Additionally, to boost credibility, I'll incorporate integrated Google Maps and reviews. A shopping cart will also be implemented to streamline the purchase of essential oil blends. Furthermore, a members-only section will be introduced to provide exclusive offers and newsletters to subscribers.

To enhance the visual appeal and user experience, I'll design custom graphics. The development stack includes Visual Studio Code and Node.js, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Firebase will handle authentication, product database management, and hosting.

Integration with the Fresha app will facilitate appointment booking and gift voucher purchases, offering client monitoring capabilities.
